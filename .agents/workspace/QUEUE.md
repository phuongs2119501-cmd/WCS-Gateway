| 2026-06-05 | GW-002 research+publish | `contract.gateway-db-keys` v1 + `Config/db500-keys.json` (full DB500 map from live source) | SPEC-GW-002 |

| 2026-06-05 | GW-005 impl | `IS7Backend`/`RealS7Backend`/`SimS7Backend` + sim-fixture + `UseMock` wiring; sim echo verified, real path unchanged | REPORT-GW-005 |
| 2026-06-05 | GW-002 impl | `tools/Db500MapGen` + `Db500Map.g.cs`; 5 Services refactored to `Db500Map.*`, byte-identical addresses | REPORT-GW-002 |

## 📋 Backlog (specced or known, not dispatched)
- **GW-001 acceptedKey on crane status** — implement `contract.crane-contention-lock v2`: set `acceptedKey` when LocationRouter binds a task (== X-Idempotency-Key), clear on complete/fail; gate late cancel. _Not in code yet._
- **GW-003 port-drift docs** — code now uses 5050; CLAUDE.md + README still say 5000. Reconcile docs.
- **GW-004 reconcile with rules.pm-workflow** — fork be-pm's shared QUEUE/TASK skeleton once published; align structure.

_GW-002 + GW-005 → shipped (see Done). Verified by gateway-pm: combined `dotnet build` green, sim echo runs, addresses byte-identical._

## 📝 Activity Log (newest first — every dispatch/verify cycle appends)
- 2026-06-05 — GW-005 + GW-002 dispatched to Codex (sequential, background) + verified: combined `dotnet build` 0/0, all 5 Services on `Db500Map.*`, SimS7Backend echo (Busy→move→plcDone→FINISHED) confirmed by Codex, real path byte-identical. QUEUE rows → Done. — gateway-pm
- 2026-06-05 — Caught heartbeat `DBX74.0` missing from catalog; bumped `contract.gateway-db-keys` v1→v2 + JSON minLength 72→76 before dispatch. — gateway-pm
- 2026-06-05 — 3.4 + 3.3 research shipped: read all 5 PLC Services, authored `Config/db500-keys.json` (canonical DB500 map, verified field-by-field), published `contract.gateway-db-keys` v1 + `spec.gateway-simulator` v1, wrote SPEC-GW-002/005. Messaged be-pm. — gateway-pm
- 2026-06-05 — Scaffolded `.agents/workspace/` (QUEUE, codex-dispatch, SPEC/TASK/REPORT templates) + 5 `.claude/skills`. Seeded backlog GW-001..004 from WcsSystem research + be-pm tips. — gateway-pm
